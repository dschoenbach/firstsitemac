    <p>Hello! My name is Dana Schoenbach. I\'92m a motivated learner with a passion for creativity, problem-solving, and figuring things out one project at a time. Whether I\'92m exploring new tools, building something from scratch, or collaborating with others, I enjoy turning ideas into something real (and ideally, a little fun). This webpage is part of my journey to grow my skills and challenge myself in new ways. Outside of the classroom, I love playing golf, hanging with my pup, and cheering for my Clemson Tigers. I love to learn and grow and can\'92t wait to see where these next steps in life take me.</p>
