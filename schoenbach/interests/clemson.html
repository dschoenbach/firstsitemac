    <h1>My Interests: Clemson Tigers</h1>

    <p><img src="../images/clemson.png" alt="Clemson Tigers" width="500"></p>

    <p>As a Clemson alumnus, I wear my orange and purple with pride! My time at Clemson introduced me to some life long friends, a future career path and passions I didn\'92t know I had. Though it\'92s been over a decade since I graduated, my time on campus feels like it was yesterday attending tailgates and football games, just hanging out on campus or even studying in the library. Clemson\'92s beauty seeps into your soul and holds onto you for life. Fight Tigers, Fight Tigers, Fight Fight Fight!</p>
