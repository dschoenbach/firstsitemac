    <h1>My Interests: Golf</h1>

    <p><img src="../images/golf.png" alt="golf" width="500"></p>

    <p>Golf has been a part of my life since I was 6 years old. Golf was always the \'93other\'94 sport I was good at but never took seriously. Always on the back burner until high school when I played 2 years on the team, but unfortunately my time on the team was not what I wanted and I ultimately put my clubs down completely for years. In college, I found friends who played and picked the game up again, which then lead to an internship with First Tee at the Houston chapter in Texas. What started as game to connect with family, became my whole life. Today, golf is a passion that will always remain and I take the opportunity to share that game any chance I get.</p>
