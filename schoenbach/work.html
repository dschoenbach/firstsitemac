    <p>I am the Program Director with First Tee Greater Wilmington. We Build Game Changers and help participants of all ages grow into confident and resilient young people. Using our character development curriculum, youth learn all the rules, fundamentals and etiquette of the game of golf while applying it to daily life on and off the golf course. As the PD, I am responsible for ensuring the safety of our participants and coaches, produce programming for participants, train coaches, as well as a number of other responsibilities. I love what I do and am lucky to do what I do each day.</p>
